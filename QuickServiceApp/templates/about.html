  <h1>About Us Page</h1>
  <p><h2>Our Mission</h2></p>
  <p><h3>For consumers:</h3></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;">
            In this pandemic we all have learnt the importance of digital means.We all have been in the situation were in the lockdown we had
        to go out to bring our essential stuff from our local shops with no other option which puts us in a thought that why canâ€™t we get 
        that online too? And why just restrict it to the lockdown period only? In order to develop our country our prime minister 
        Shri Narendra Modi himself is trying to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy by the means of 
        digital India. So let us also take a step forth and be a part of this campaign.
    </p>
    <p><h3>For entrepreneurs:</h3></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;">
            We all are affected in the lockdown where people prefer online shopping rather than coming to shop to purchase. It has been 
        observed that now a days lockdown or no, people prefer online shopping rather than going to stores. This has affected a lot of 
        people and many had to even shut down their shops due to losses. This has made all small-scale entrepreneurs to think a way out 
        of this situation and increase the sale. We would say why run away from online modes it is time to evolve your methods and be a 
        part of digital India. Many of you think how to bring your shop online but, all of you have the same question that is how?
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;">
            Do not worry we have a common solution for consumers as well as entrepreneurs. Our website connects consumers to the local 
        stores to buy and sell stuff online with home delivery option. 
    </p>
    <h1>How it Works</h1>
    <p><h3>Shops:</h3></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;">
        Local shops can register on our website and add the information of their products. When a consumer places order it will be 
        visible as soon as you log into your account along with the consumer address, name and contact number. For payment we have cash 
        on delivery. When a consumer receives the order that order will disappear from the website.
    </p>
    <p><h3>Consumers:</h3></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;">
        When you register into our website the pin-code that you enter will be used to show you the shops in your locality distributed 
        category wise for your convenience. When you will view a particular store, you will be able to see all the available products 
        listed category wise and the map of that particular store will be available if provided by the shop. You can click on the 
        product you want to purchase and the details of that product will be available along with a add to cart option. After placing 
        order, you can view that in orders option where on receiving a delivery you need to click on received button to inform that you 
        have received your product always remember to do this step as doing this will verify the shop that you have received the order. 
        In the navigation bar you can access your cart, previous orders placed, orders which are yet to be delivered and a sign out 
        option.
